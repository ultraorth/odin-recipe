<h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100g pancetta</li>
            <!--Converted metric measurements on hover-->
            <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>50g parmesan</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>350g spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>
            <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Sea salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        </ul>

    
<dl><h3>Method</h3></dl> 
    <dt><h4>STEP 1</h4></dt>
        <dd>
            Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.
        </dd>
    <dt><h4>STEP 2</h4></dt>
        <dd>
            Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. 
            Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together. 
        </dd>
    <dt><h4>STEP 3</h4></dt>
        <dd>
            Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. 
            Set everything aside.
        </dd>
    <dt><h4>STEP 4</h4></dt>
        <dd>
            Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
        </dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 5</h3></dt>
        <dd>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 6</h3></dt>
        <dd>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 7</h3></dt>
        <dd>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 8</h3></dt>
        <dd>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.</dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 9</h3></dt>
        <dd>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 10</h3></dt>
        <dd>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.</dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 11</h3></dt>
        <dd>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</dd>
    <dt><h3>STEP 12</h3></dt>
        <dd>Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</dd>
