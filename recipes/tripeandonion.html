            <dd>
                Put the tripe into a saucepan with a quarter cupful of water, 
                with the lid on, place on the hob for 8-10 minutes approx.
            </dd>
        <dt><h4>STEP 2</h4></dt>
            <dd>
                Discard the liquor in the pot, add the sliced onion and cover with cold milk. 
                Simmer gently for 1 hour approx. until the tripe is tender. 
            </dd>
        <dt><h4>STEP 3</h4></dt>
            <dd>
                Strain off the milk, thicken with roux, season with salt and pepper. 
                Pour the milk back into the saucepan with the tripe, heat through. 
                Check seasoning, it will take quite a bit of pepper. 
                Serve on a slice of buttered white bread.
